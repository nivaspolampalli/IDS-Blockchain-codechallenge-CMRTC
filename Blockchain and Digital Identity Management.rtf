\fs22  \fs32\par
\b Overview\fs22\par
\b0 Digital identity management is crucial in today\rquote s connected world, where individuals need to authenticate themselves across various online platforms. Traditional methods of identity management\f1\emdash\f0 such as usernames, passwords, and centralized systems\f1\emdash\f0 are increasingly vulnerable to breaches, fraud, and privacy invasions. Blockchain technology offers a paradigm shift in managing digital identities, enhancing security, ensuring privacy, and empowering users with more control over their personal data.\par
This document explores the role of blockchain in digital identity management, discussing its benefits, challenges, case studies, and future applications.\par
\fs32\par
\b 1. Understanding Digital Identity\par
\b0\fs22 A digital identity is the representation of an individual or entity in the digital world. It is used to access services like online banking, e-commerce, social media, healthcare, government services, and more. In traditional models, digital identities are often stored in centralized databases, which are susceptible to breaches, loss of control, and privacy violations.\fs28\par
\b Traditional Identity Management Issues:\b0\fs22\par
Centralization: Most systems are controlled by a single authority (e.g., a bank or social media company), giving that entity full control over your data.\par
Data Breaches: Personal information stored in centralized databases is vulnerable to hacking.\par
Privacy Concerns: Companies and governments have access to sensitive data, often without providing transparency about how it is used.\par
Lack of User Control: Users often lack the ability to fully manage or even delete their digital identities.\par
\b\fs32 2. How Blockchain Enhances Digital Identity Management\fs22\par
\b0 Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that allows data to be stored securely and transparently across a network of computers. Blockchain offers a powerful solution to the challenges faced by traditional identity management systems.\par
\b\fs28 Key Benefits of Blockchain in Digital Identity Management:\b0\par
